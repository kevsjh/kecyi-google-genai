            <AccordionTrigger>How long will it take to generate my AI photo</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
                In general, most of the design features takes about 20-50 seconds to generate the AI photo.
                This is quicker than most of the other AI design tools in the market. Video generation usually takes around 1-2 minutes.

                In the event the design request fails and the photo is not generated, you will not be charged any credit.
